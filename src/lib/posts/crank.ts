Have you listened to black midi? This sound like anything you have heard before, sounds like rock with shoegaze voices and a lot of instrumentation and dissonance feeling like is some kind of garage - noise rock. Black midi has been a pioneer on this style, pushing this genre boundaries, but indie bands like gilla band and model/actriz using industrial and more noise elements have caught my attention, and gave it a new horizon, but wasnt until black country new road crashed this year marking a checkpoint on music, a new genre of rock is arriving,  is it good? Crank wave is a a new mixup of the post punk revival element, with hard PIL influences here and there, a new experimental / garage/ noise/ post punk with hard instrumentation, squids using big band ambient and other bands pushing even more, and, at this point, it is being a revival on the art rock style.

Both squid new album, black country and the promising model / actriz album are showing those influences, and not only that, but permeating on conceptual albums that show the comeback of art rock in a more nu style that would make david byrne and John lydon rejoice.
