Funny stuff, well, hyper pop got its time, it was a funny thing to do, combine a blend of genres and staple them with bubblegum pop, but now, i present you a circus angsty release....

Stomach book in its latest album depicts a deeper swim in what the hyper pop is or could have been, diving between genres like dark cabaret and emo with a heavy focus on electronics, known for their collabs with ada rook, this artist is a chaotic festival.

Fukuoka girl which is the opening shows the focus of the release a circus like high speed sound with a catchy danceable melody and high vocals, the entire album uses a satiric style while also kinda gore scenarios, as seen in fukuoka girl and my diorama, while this last song starts the roller coaster of harshness with screams in certain parts and blending with melodies, as seen in bambi and also in sick sick sick

in general is a great release maintaining a sincere focus and a great production, highly consistent touching deep themes like envy, loneliness.`
