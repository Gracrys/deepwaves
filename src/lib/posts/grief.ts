Oh sweet, this album hit me like a train, basically bandcamp gave it many good reviews and putting as one of the albums of the year, thats hot, anyways, the album has a great intro, slow paced with **The bird, the lion and the wildkin** and increases the pace with **kilonova** melodic voices, soft compasses until a heavy riff arrives, which can be seen, or felt, at a higher streak in the song **are you the only one now?** which starts as a melancholic ballad, soft, soft guitar tones, nice pace, until hit like a anxiety dream with the second part of the song and heavy voices fill the ambient

**Clawing out** is an interesting case, the zeal and ardor elements are noticeable in every song but mixed reactions were seen as the song involves electronic elements, and even noise, the album in general can be felt with elements like industrial, noise, black metal and blues, melodic voices and gutural fill the pace of the songs and doesnt feel repetitive, the album is really well varied and well organized, also, we can feel some elements of crank wave here and there, personally, zeal and ardor was a sleeper for me, i didnt pay much attention to it before in the old albums but these last ones marked a new age for the band between my lists, the melody instrumentation is excellent, so, glad to see it.
