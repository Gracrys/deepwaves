This album made me feel things, you can feel a lot of bjork vibes, or aurora, but in general is deep masterpiece composed by Juana Molina which emcompases her own blend of experimentation, she mentions that she just started going deeper from what she could do with her singing, her guitar, making loops and using ambient backgrounds while also maintaining a style of folk and local music from her country, Argentina

This albums starts with a really experimental beat in **Un Dia** which shows repetitive loops of her singing and electronic but also maintaning a style of IDM, folk, and a nice compas, not as soft as ambient, or downtempo, but a really good mix which circles these alternative vibes, also depicts a great way as the artist breaks the harmony, which i didnt expect at all, but mixed really well.
the second song, **vive solo** shows the same vibe, the album in general flows really well, and blends one song into another wijuanamolinat crashing, the second song from the album felt weaker than the first because maintained the same melody and vibes, the lyrics felt kinda repetitive but in general was a good continuation from the first song and felt like a softer side, from that song on you can feel the use of drums in a more natural, organic way

**Los hongos de marosa** catched me up again and kept me on the edge of the seat, felt psychodelic, the drums made a great compass and the lyrics felt neat, it was such a trip back and forth, for the next song **Â¿Quien?** is where you can feel like she breaks the mold, feels different, less like an ambient more like a psychodelic song, with a bunch of ups and downs, changes in melody, harmony, and a lot of filter in the music and her voice overall, which works as a catalyzer and keeps you steady trying to focus on many things at the time, the melody is really well composed, i felt some glitchy jumps here and there but the flow was really good, the finish was a nice soft change of pace.

Overall the album takes a good road of folk and paviments it with heavy experimentation, electronics and a good, i mean great use of vocals all around, which doesnt feel like lyrics but another instrument in the path of the songs.
