You are in your car, you have your mix of 20 best songs of [insert your name here], which includes creep, reason (hoobastank), aerials, thriller, etc, and you assume those 20 songs can be listened, and are correctly arranged to fulfill any hole that appears and appeals to any emotion of the human spectrum rises on you, well, you could say that, but are you sure? there is a vast ocean of music out there and you are telling me that bohemian rhapsody is the peak of the music? the first step is understanding that, is, you are swimming in a half full cup thinking thats the entirely of the universe, of this universe.

Is pretty easy to enjoy a song, or most important, an album, just play it through, you can sit, close your eyes and just listen it through, but thats pretty boring isnt it? so, you can do something meanwhile that doesnt require much of your attention, washing dishes, read some articles, draw something, but try to focus on the music, on the melodies, try to differentiate all the instruments in the song, the voices, what do they say, why do they say that, and how the melody blends with the voice and lyrics, why would a violin play here, after that, you will do all of this unconsciously, but, try not to take it as a chore, but as something that will expand your experience, start with a few songs that you like, and keep digging through, take that 'creep' song, and play it, you dont have to play it on high volume, but just enough so you can hear all the instruments, why would he play that guitar there, why he raises the voice, and, how does that blends, how does that make sense, the second time you listen to it, you will think something between the lines of "damn, here comes that guitar rifff asndakdsbkjd" and drown into the feeling.

Part of understanding, of giving up to music is falling up to passion, is understanding that you will never fulfill you musical needs, is something you will understand later, most people take this road for a brief moment, they dig deep into the more... enriching sonettos for a while, they dig into a style, genre, finding a good comfort spot, and they just swim that pond for a while, they have found what they were looking for, they found that all heavy metal is not just iron maiden and black sabbath, but a little more, and they find more styles, more bands, and they stay there, is what they were looking for, but why stay there, when you can find the connection  between, lets say, heavy metal and drum and bass? and now you have two genres that you love and enjoy, later you find musique concrete, and so on, enjoying all music genres, all styles, and finding sweet spots here and there, thats the depth of the journey.

Some journeys are harder than others, some styles are harder to get into, i love experimental music,  i love all kind of stuff, but it have been hard for me to get into swans and ambient, swans and  whatever that surrounds the band, that style, folk - industrial noise stuff. 
Most pop, rock, even modern hip hop is easy listen stuff, you can jump onto it and feel nice and dig more, everything is at the palms of your hands, you like coldplay, you have a bunch of artists like it, genres like ballads, soft rock, rock, heavy rock, etc, you can dig and find stuff you like pretty easy, what happens with more harder genres, industrial rock, blues rock, folk rock, barroque rock, well, is harder to get into, is harder to find more, and is harder to understand, but is part of the journey, a person that enjoys musique concrete or horrorcore has cultivated that taste deeper and harder than someone that.... Is just a big fan of pop rock in general, or more specific... lets say, thrash metal, is harder to listen, if you dont believe me, give it a try. And thats part of the journey, having an open mind, giving those a try, at the end of the day, you may not have enjoyed coil, swans, throbbing gristle, but maybe you found one or two songs in that skinny puppy album...

**Albums**: Why would i listen to an entire album if i only like 2 songs from this band....
Because dork, as you keep digging into music you understand how much of a enriching journey an album is, it is an organized library of songs, in a certain order, following certain parameters that go along with that certain song you may have liked or will enjoy, most of the time we hit an album, blindly, not knowing what to expect.
Is the easiest way to find a song closer to what you like, while also enjoying a history, albums also come in creative ways that help the story unfold, and also, conceptual albums exist.

Conceptual albums follow a.... duh.. concept, tell a story in more compact way, like, dont know, a trip to space (clipping) or going to hell (canserbero), they follow patterns and guide you through a path.

That's it, there is no strategy to enjoying an album or getting into some kind of music, is just going along, is one of the easiest hobbies to get into while also really fullfilling, i got into this also because i could do any other stuff while enjoying music, like writing this article, working, and at this point im pretty hard to amaze, you may feel like you have hard everything and more, you know how most songs will unfold but, the marvels still lie there, you will always get surprised some way. 

You just have to dig, and enjoy the music, close your eyes.
