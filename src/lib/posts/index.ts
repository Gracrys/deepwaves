Many genres come from small underground scenes, the same way many rock subgenres started in small garages and local movements, and this is the case for **glitchcore** and **glitchhop** in general

### VaporWave
In 2010 _Vaporwave_ started banging our speakers and youtube recommendations, for someone who was really into glitch music with artists like the _the glitch mob_, and _crosses †††_ , and loved the glitch aesthetic, the same art i was doing and sharing, glitch was many times called wrongly "vapor wave", vapor wave represented a softer melody, like ambient, with smaller jumps, almost not scratches and overall, a pastel aesthetic using some  1990s elements, more like a leaning towards a more vintage side, the difference was pretty obvious, but is not like there were some big parameters to difference between one or the another, only for people who cared about the genres and styles.


### Chiptune
_Chiptune_ was a pet genre, from time you could listen to some of these beats on small artists, _nintendocore_ got a more wider audience from britain and europe, with that 8bits style but with more drum and bass influence.

### Glitch Predecessors
For glitch it was almost the same case, small artists using these jumps, scratches and recording errors and sampling, saturating, etc. In clubs and mixes, artists like _autechre_  and _coil_, while others like _the glitch mob_, used this sound and embraced it, using it as a trademark, the glitch mob sound was more house-like, deviating from rave styles and getting more elements of artists like _deadmou5_.


### GlitchCore
Now in 2021-2022, we are getting almost the same issue, _Glitchcore_ was a a really old genre, that was like a step further from  _drill and bass_, _chiptune_, _nintendocore_ an most important, _breakcore_ and _glitch hop_. 

_GlitchCore_ was a step further, not only it was a more stronger genre, faster tempo (like way faster speed, 170-190+) but more elements, aggresive drums, inclusion of noise, and others elements, artists like _Venetian Snares_, _bong-ra_ and _igorr_ played with the genre between their breakcore eps, and later artists like _sewerslvt, lolishit, vertigoaway, machinegrl_, and others, embraced the genre, using it as main style and even in aesthetics, most of them used anime elements fused with glitch designs of oversaturated colors and chopped pictures, until now, for anybody who wants to get into that genre, he can can just listen to some sewerslvt, is one of the best doors for that big palace of musical abstraction.

Knowing about how these movements shaped the music we have now is big, it is product of iteration and iteration, experimentation over years, maybe decades, while also, helping label subgenres and tying knots in the history of music, even artists from the pop scene (like grimes) got influenced by that style of glitch and used it.

Another issue here is, do we have objective ways of labeling genres? Kinda, we get to label these by ear most of the times, like "it may be this because sounds like this song", and we can be wrong, in the case of glitchcore, the tempo, and use of musical elements play a big part, but there are many other genres in the suffix of -core in the electronic nature that we may confuse.

Well, it starts like any other noise album,white noise, but man, these samples, these melodies, for sure are catchy, long time without listening to some power noise album, has a nice set of drums, sounds raw, aggresive, and has that little spice of industrial that just hits the right spot
_Smoke n' mirrorz_ is a trip between harsh noise and a crazy set of drums glitching between sides
_Discopathology_ sounds like a good disco song, which you would dance in some oldschool rave, excepting that is full of white noise, anxiety and power electronics, but has a nice constituted, processed melody, with some breakdowns, nice and fresh

Not much to say about this small album, but made me return to this blog so... for sure is a lot lol

		summary: 'An upbeat downbeat album',
		tags: ['#electronic','#triphop', '#alternative', '#downtempo'],
		md: `

Basically, is a trip hop band, with a more fast style, at the peak, between the lines of downtempo and alternative, and i love trip hop.

Most trip hop bands have some style, something that differentiates them, portishead had these fast beats on slow songs, tricky has that dark rhythm, sick beats and raspy lyrics of rap

War stories is a consistent album, all songs has that cohesive instrumental melody, starting with a cloud of sounds, a misty trip hop beat, and going forward with a more faster tempo, all the songs follow this pattern, and the issue with trip hop is the fact that most songs sound repetitive, or even boring if you arent into these ambiental slow beats, but unkle knows how to manage that pretty well, _twillight_ is their slower song, and stills grows in that increasing pace, not harder, but more ambiental, or spiritual, like would do radiohead on kid a.

_hold my hand, restless and keys to the kingdom_ are great singles and examples of that style, thst limbo he makes, how a song grows from a downtempo beat, a trip hop style to a more experimental, - alternative one, including rock, electronics, and even some noise, you can compare it with moby, but in unkle, some songs like, for example flute and string from moby grow exponentially to machete from the same artist. Unkle is richer on experimentation, yes, but doesnt make moby a weak artist, just someone who knows how to stamp their differences into their albums and songs. 

_Price you pay_ is another slow song by unkle, instrumental, some ethereal lyrics, and a little of anxiety in the background accompanied with high string tones, until it grows to a more aggressive approach, stamped onto a 4/4 battery.

Unkle is a master piece of the trip hop, and alternative, a mix of both, and  this albums implies the border and inspiration for some great works of these genres.

This album, this band, is one of the best progressive metal bands i have heard, the voice is just so changing and emotional, but at the same time, technical, the keyboard gives it a little cybernetic style and the rythmn is changing constantly, i always compared it to the mars volta
Ok, i am not a rooting fan of progressive, im more a fan of industrial, this band is like... at the brink of these two worlds, chilling electronic beats on a upchanging metal sound
_poetry in motion_ is a banger of styles, following the voice of the singer
_the cube_ is an upbeat  song about maths and stuff, they have that really nerdy style, but gets on nice

this is their first album, i have heard more from them but sounds... so different, but this album, is just fantastic for fans of high speed progressive like dragonforce or cyberwings, but also you can compare them to sybreed on electronic metal or symphony x.

I have been a fan of trip hop since a long time, being one of my favs genres, so.. imagine liking harsh noise and trip hop... yes...
And Zero 7 is one of the most complete bands in that genre, an this album, i may say that is the peak of said band, they have more electronic works than anyhing else, in this album we can listen to a wide variety of downtempo inmersive beats, for me, this is bliss
destiny and waiting line show Sia voice, yes, Sia, which adds a more pop sound without getting out from the vibes of the album

distractions is a sweet foam of candies over a downtempo beat, the atmosphere is excelent, but you get overly inmersed when she says "i love you"

the album is one of the master pieces of trip hop in general, and also, a sleeper, over subestimated and not that known, but if you like air, or portishead, this is your next step

		md: `
Well... lately in this century, metal has turned a little poppy or has fused with more poppy genres like trap, rap, punk rock, etc, one example of this, is poppy, an artist that has catchy pop sounds with an inmersive metal background, or the all so lovely babymetal.
and this album, despite this drowns into a more industrial scene.

This album starts with a harsh intro of noise and industrial, metal percusion and strident melodies with screams, going harder and deeper with each song.
peacesign!! doesnt gets less melodious, is still a great intro, not too aggresive, but with a nice shock factor,  i mean _concrete bubble_ starts with some aangsty screams showing big signs of anxiety and sharing them, the album gets softer with the time, being the last two songs _mistake_ and _(cant) keep it together_ being softer and more poppy with just normal electronic industrial

the album shows a new angle to modern industrial, getting more noisy and more pop - punk but with the same feelings of anxiety, despair, a great album indeed

		tags: ['#electronics','#trap', '#rap', '#lofi', '#joji'],
		md: `
Well... Joji is not that underground or obscure as you may know, and neither that experimental, just catchy pop song with lofi style or indie style ~despite being part of 88rising~ and this album just used a higher electronic production and trp style... kind of what pink guy would have done, except that pink guy is dead, filthy frank is also dead, and joji is just sad.

This album is nothing new on georgie miller career, the same kind of songs that you would put at the end of a party... excepting that for some reason, the tables turned and zoomers love this feeling of despair and introspection between their poppy trappy - electronic - rap songs just to make them look a little more intellectual or closer to their inner self... hillarious, but normal

Joji has became the symbol of depressing rap after what happened with emo trap and cloud rap, is just the symbol of lofi rap after some jazz rap oldschools, and this album is just a step further, great collabs, longer amount of songs (maybe because of the fact that this is not an ep like the others of the same artists), and despite some of the scandals about his story this is just a mark, an engraving into pop music nowadays, i really like joji, even over some of my experimental avant garde - noisy packed artists... 

This album starts with the classic sad song excepting that shows a drum machine sound over the same electronic midi melody that always accompanied joji, soft melodies, rnb, catchy, whatever you may call it, this one, called *tick tock* which depicts a melody 4/4 with a tickling sound, really good rhytmn, not amusing
but, point in favor of joji, man, great lyrics
_As time keeps slipping away_ sounds so repetitive, is kind of naive, but the sum of all the parts of the song make the chorus... really interesting.

*modus* is another banger, trap based song with high pitched parts, remind me of ol' pink guy... real good lyrics and the melody and harmony in the chorus is just... blessed.

*run* was the first single of the album, launched some time ago really catched my attention, i felt identified by the video and lyrics, same style of sad joji, i think if i give this song a 8 is because of an emotional attachment to mny of the songs
the collab with diplo was kind of cool, diplo has that... ability to adapt to others style as seen in lsd in which i also made a review long ago, is like adding that higher production that maybe joji needed to feel sometimes in his works... dont know, doesnt make a big of difference, but, adds to the album indeed

gimme love is like the weaker song in the album, maybe because is turning towards pop... yep... feels more catchy and repetitive __not saying that the others songs arent repetitive__ ...

i think the quality of this work stays on its emotional value, i cannot get to a conclusion yet, but i must say that it really does touch my heart`

Noise since the start of the album, some intro is passed and so comes a big fuzz which accompanies all the songs,

riffs,
drums
screeches
and more can be said about this chaotic album which surprised me, startled would i say

__What Have I Let The World Make Of Me __ Being the most consistent piece, some riffs at a dissonant tempo and a classic moombaton sound in the background

I feel deeply sorry for the lack of context, just listen to this emotional horror noise album, you will really like it if you are into this kind of stuff

One of my favs bands, that can crash into a soft voice with a soothing piano to a harsh screamo punk

The first song of the album is a soothing guitar melody which also depicts the soft voice of this frontman, one of the best i have seen in concerts.
Followed by a harsh aggresive song, __ゆきこさん__ , also named __Yukiko-san__ which starts the first two seconds with an strident scream, i dont understand japanese that well, but is not needed to understand, to feel the emotions in the songs, the voice changes, and the variant rythmn.

The variant, experimental harmony in the songs make such a background, how all the instruments seem like improvising in company, and how the main focus is obviously, midori voice
But honestly, i think the most important fact about the band, is the energetic voice of the singer, dancing and trashing all around the scenary.
Highly recommended for avant garde fans.

At first i didnt wanted to check on this album, i appreciate Arca work, he is a beast live, great producer and as an amazing concept in her music.

But also i tend to feel deply connected, not only because i feel like i can understand her deeply, words, style, struggle, (not that im a trans)but also has a style with some drops of **sophie**, some of **bjork**, etc..

Well the album, it goes in progression, the arrangement of songs is excelent, i was expecting that collab with **Rosalia**, and **KLK** brought it to me, which made me wantto listen the album... is a harsh experimental - gitchy sound with a moombatoon - reggaeton melody, catchy and at the same time further the ring

but the song which made me into it was **machote**, that song is not only... hilarious to me, but also, take a relisen to it, is a struggle, a song made from loneliness and the seek of these pinches of pleasure

has that old sound of arca, some depresso - warm melody in its lyrics. nice stuff

Now, for the sound that left me speechless, **Afterwards**, was unexpected, i had to check my playlist again to see if i wasnt listening to **bjork**, and i was... that collab was just too strong, not all experimental artists have that pleasure, this pushes this album over the scale

I have been a big fan of japanese experimental music, like kyo, ningen isu, and avantgarde, they have a way of blending.... or playing with dissonant harmonies, and this album, does that.
this album, well the single; **yume wo mijou** made me want to look for the album, sadly, it was hard to look for some kanji symbols... but at last, found it, an album packed with a noise accompanied vocals in progression
and emotionally charged yellings to the modern life.
the electronics used in the album makes a soft background along with the noisy parts and harsh riffs,
has some kind of generic sound in some songs, but its progression in some songs like narashite, by using a faster pace it does change the sentiment of the song and the style of the album in general, 
but by changing some style at the end of some songs doesnt make the album more appealing, it can sounds a litte too repetitive or generic, and the voice of the girl, despite the many changes of pitch doesnt make the effect that some others noise rock albums use.
Great album, can be real trip at first listening, but is not that fresh as it may sounds conceptually speaking

Well first thing first, i love **RelapseRecords** I mean, they have brought many doom - stoner bands like **Red fang** or **Kylesa** and **nothing** is not an exception of that style, A doom style into a blackgaze band, the vocals are great, raw and changing, and just a velvet cape of noise mesmerizes your senses with energy of black and doom metal, great  stuff, feels harsh, at the kind of solstafir but at the same time not tha heavy like you would get from the first albums of solstafir or merzbow.

This album made me rethink about if grunge is really dead, maybe it is, but this, is a new wave for it, and would strike again the charts.

I dont say that this album would become a top seller, but has the energy, the emotion, the production, of a good grunge-garage rock album, even for a sixteen girl and her friends, the fuzz of the guitars feel excelent, invigorant, the drums remind me of dave grohl, has that **hole** energy, but i kind of like this artist over hole... (not a big fan of Courtney) The vocals are soft, tender when they have to be, overall in the other albums, being this one the most hard of them all, with sturdy vocals, hard screams, and a wall of noise that pushes you over.`,

			<p>The most expected album of the year, atleast for me, <b> LSD </b> came in April,12 and broke out all the expectations with a fresh syle and innovative.</p>
			<p> Got a nice audience since its single <b> Genius </b>, a neo psychodelic style with the soft melodies of <b> Sia </b> and <b> Labyrinth </b> along with a great harmony from <b> Diplo </b> and some catchy-pop lyrics, that, until now i cant stop singing them in the shower.
			<p> With the arrival of <b> Thunderclouds </b> they had paved a road, i expected a conceptual album, and the video came to me for surprise, a surrealist interpretation of the principal characters of the album, and, at the same time, a new path to follow by each one of the pilars of this story </p>
			<p> This album, when i first listened to it, it was unexpected, i got myself inmersed into a experimental melody of neo-psychodelia with a presentation like that of <i> some kind of magic </i> or <i> Welcome to the world of plastic beach </i> both from gorillaz, the presentation of a new world, showing o you a new musical product unique and amazing you with some guitar riffs just arriving the first song <b> Welcome to the wonderful world of </b>. The voices created an ambient and great melody, with lyrics talking about world and trips with a twist, some songs depicting that feelings are <b> Thunderclouds </b>, <b> Its Time </b> and <b> Genius </b>,
			this masterpiece consists in a return of what was the bubblegum pop of the 80s with some subtle voices from <b> Sia </b> electronic melodies from <b> Diplo </b> and at the same time modern rythmn with some effects like glitch and danceable sounds.
			A sweet rythmn floats all over the album and waves between sweet tones and happy ones, each songs leaves you wanting for more and you can feel it, not only as a pop danceable song, but even more, in the emotional spectrum </p>
			<p> This album could make a difference, bringing back that psychodelic style, like that of tame imapala or with that acid style of grimes, and even, influentiate many bands from the pop genre... </p>

<p> I listened to this one with a more mature ear, and reminded me of that old bliss, but, even, felt more... harsh... atleast by the side of <b> locusts</b>, like a dreaded end to a big symphony, some noise in the background, <b> together </b>, was softer, sounded more like the old ghosts, enveloping me in a warm feel, feeling myself and the songs, like one, together, every movement felt low paced, but wonderful.</p>		<p> Not my favorite album of <b>NIN</b>, not a big fan of ambient, and dark ambient makes me kind of anxious, i have less of that feeling with ghosts than with other pieces of the same genre to be honest, and, after their new path into soundtracks, they are doing a great work, i feel glad listening to them again, even, in their darkest-ambiental hours....`

And doesnt make enough justice for the album</p>

<p>This is a journey, an album that varies and plays with noise, instruments, and voices, bertrand cantat does a great job, choosing diferent tones for his voices in different songs, Des visages des figures and L'Appartment shows a softer voice, intropective, emotional. Le grand incendie shows a heavier tone, and L'Enfant Roi, opens the album, using a thin falsetto in a repetitive kind of trippy instrumental, about just, a piece of a normal life.</p>

		<p>All the album is full of different metaphores to life, playing with many images and at the same time depicting just, ordinary moments.</p>

<p>Le grand incendie shows a strident harmonica playing in company of stepped hard  drums, many references to riots, or atleast, just, liberation, until the words "cour" appear into place, meaning a rift of water, yelling at the microphone, just increasing the noise in the song, until the last explosion of instruments bursting the harmony.</p>

<p>Lost, which made me fall in love completely, is at first, just a note, an inner observation of loneliness... which ends in desesperation, he plays in a complete amazing way with emotions, his voice becomes raspy or hoarse while the song pases, while in the song, he starts talking more about psychological consequences... Until he explodes, the image of the single is really amazing, a doodle of a wolf barking at.. anything, or whatever that appears in the picture, which does a good job explaining the song at first. the song becomes harder, faster, and he loses it, he screams to the listener i'm lost</p>

<p>The album does a great job in production, harmony and message, its style is something complex, not boring or repetitive, and even experimental, and the band is kind of obscure outside France, one of my favorites gems.</p>	`

Found this band by following some **faust** and **dalek** albums, both masters of the noise genre and this orchestra is not to be left behind, this is a really undrstimated album, full of noise but at the same time, instrumentation, a really high quality production and with a clean improvisation.

Comes soft at first, a thin noise wall separates the voices and the trumpets, bass, drums, etc, while it feels afterwards blending until it reaches an only voice, the vocals are clean, lyrical, emotionals, and just by the end of the album, it gets more raw, the lyrics become parts of the album and i could listen was sweet moans.

The albums feels really natural and emotional, touching i would say, in some parts becoming an anxiety passage, in others, a brink of illumination in a room full of vapor.
