May our chambers be full is a doom - blackgaze - stoner album that just resonates with some melodic soft voices from this thou companion, Emma Ruth Rundle

I love the influence of shoegaze at every songstart, _killing floor and monolith_ are some soft clouds arriving in the skies, passing, melancholic, emotional, ending in a storm of screams and piercing chants from Emma

The notes at _ancestral Recall_ are hold, every word she sings, until the guttural hits, and you are reminded, that this is not a not a blackgaze or post metal album, that this song hits hard on the stoner metal spectrum, getting blackened for every guitar riff, drum and scream.

and we arrive on _Magickal Cost_ Magical indeed, a soft song, like a ballad from the cranberries, getting over a rapid battery tempo, the songs roll around a formula, softer to heavy. Is the album repetitive? Yes but no, while the songs may follow a pattern, and the album is organized in some industrial flavor, high to low to high, the sound is so new, amazing, and rich, i havent listened to anything similar since _Brando_ or _bull_ from the collaborative album of sco))tt (scott walker ft sunn o))) maybe, kaada and patton, but, the first one, went with an ominous, sometimes scary, uneasy sound towards are more noisy one with melodic voices, this album, flows from a melodic sound, emotional, and swims towards a more aggresive one, in a heavy metal strike.

_The valley_ is desperation, anxiety, a crawl of a soft mellody flowing through.

In the case of **The Helm of Sorrows**
It hits harder, a more sturdy begginning with strong screams and an impenetrable noise wall, and a haunting melody in the back in _Orphan Limbs_

The rest of the album is more fast paced, _recurrence_ is a strong song, full of power, with some melodic parts

And finishing in one song, that made me check the album, hollywood, is just a master piece of post metal - blackgaze - doom, the voice is catchy, soft, the sound is danceable, melodic, and drags you to the highs and lows of the song, and the emotions depicted.

This is a style i crave, something not much abused, and a mix of blackgaze with melodic voices and stoner is so amazing, since alcest starting touching a more high level of listeners, solstafir, but obviously, artists like boris and sunn o)) ft scott, is so invigorating emotionally, and doesnt brings you down like a doom song, but rather keeps you floating in a sea of noisy foam.
