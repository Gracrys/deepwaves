lifelover

Dissonant Dsbm with heavy nostalgic tones, starts with the classic suffering thematic in nackskot and finishes the song with a out of contrast children chant, love, pitch and black melody made me hit the album in awe, the harmony goes from fuzz and angst and waves into piano back and forth in a bittersweet tone.

Stockholm incorporates a more softer sound with a doom melody and a whistle, making of a wavy ballad.

The album in general embraces the noise, the fuzz and the classic dsbm suffering without staying repetitive or boring, being relaxing, introspective even comfy in a way.
