Love jumping to a little ramble, so, i will do it, the story started like this, the olympics opening event invited out of surprise for us to Gojira, because it was a french band and wanted to show a different side of the olympics events... This was indeed a surprise the same way they gave snoop dogg a funny blunt shaped torch, anyways, this olympic event, the start scene around the gojira song, was hit by an interesting shock factor, a decapited Marie Antoniette being shown from what looked like the prison where was helf captive, not only that, as the scene passes the camera shows the entirety of the castle-like building showing many more of the red crimsom dressed beheaded woman singing, as gojira starts to play, a metal song.
This was indeed the most metal thing they could do, and was the most interesting part of the olympics starting event (because the pintoresque recreation of the last supper was kinda off) and so it was depicted, obviously as a satanic event, and not what it should have depicted.

The event starts with some scenes of the french revolution, and the idea of the entire event was to show a shoot to freedom, **ah Ça Ira** is a known song of liberty for the french culture, gojira playing it was show a representation to different cultures without deviating from the french spirit, it start with symphonic opera elements showing a nice heavy paced symphonic metal song, which, in my opinion, should have been longer.
